# Summary of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement

On October 4, 2015, Ministers of the 12 Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) countries –
Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Peru, Singapore, United States, and Vietnam – announced conclusion of their
negotiations. The result is a high-standard, ambitious, comprehensive, and balanced
agreement that will promote economic growth; support the creation and retention of
jobs; enhance innovation, productivity and competitiveness; raise living standards;
reduce poverty in our countries; and promote transparency, good governance, and
enhanced labor and environmental protections. We envision conclusion of this
agreement, with its new and high standards for trade and investment in the Asia Pacific,
as an important step toward our ultimate goal of open trade and regional integration
across the region.

## KEY FEATURES

Five defining features make the Trans-Pacific Partnership a landmark 21st-century
agreement, setting a new standard for global trade while taking up next-generation
issues. These features include:

* Comprehensive market access. The TPP eliminates or reduces tariff and non-tariff
  barriers across substantially all trade in goods and services and covers the full
  spectrum of trade, including goods and services trade and investment, so as to create
  new opportunities and benefits for our businesses, workers, and consumers.

* Regional approach to commitments. The TPP facilitates the development of
  production and supply chains, and seamless trade, enhancing efficiency and
  supporting our goal of creating and supporting jobs, raising living standards,
  enhancing conservation efforts, and facilitating cross-border integration, as well as
  opening domestic markets.

* Addressing new trade challenges. The TPP promotes innovation, productivity, and
  competitiveness by addressing new issues, including the development of the digital
  economy, and the role of state-owned enterprises in the global economy.

* Inclusive trade. The TPP includes new elements that seek to ensure that economies
  at all levels of development and businesses of all sizes can benefit from trade. It
  includes commitments to help small- and medium-sized businesses understand the
  Agreement, take advantage of its opportunities, and bring their unique challenges to
  the attention of the TPP governments. It also includes specific commitments on
  development and trade capacity building, to ensure that all Parties are able to meet
  the commitments in the Agreement and take full advantage of its benefits.

* Platform for regional integration. The TPP is intended as a platform for regional
  economic integration and designed to include additional economies across the AsiaPacific
  region.

## SCOPE

* The TPP includes 30 chapters covering trade and trade-related issues, beginning with
  trade in goods and continuing through customs and trade facilitation; sanitary and
  phytosanitary measures; technical barriers to trade; trade remedies; investment;
  services; electronic commerce; government procurement; intellectual property;
  labour; environment; ‘horizontal’ chapters meant to ensure that TPP fulfils its
  potential for development, competitiveness, and inclusiveness; dispute settlement,
  exceptions, and institutional provisions.

* In addition to updating traditional approaches to issues covered by previous free
  trade agreements (FTAs), the TPP incorporates new and emerging trade issues and
  cross-cutting issues. These include issues related to the Internet and the digital
  economy, the participation of state-owned enterprises in international trade and
  investment, the ability of small businesses to take advantage of trade agreements,
  and other topics.

* TPP unites a diverse group of countries – diverse by geography, language and
  history, size, and levels of development. All TPP countries recognize that diversity is
  a unique asset, but also one which requires close cooperation, capacity-building for
  the lesser-developed TPP countries, and in some cases special transitional periods
  and mechanisms which offer some TPP partners additional time, where warranted, to
  develop capacity to implement new obligations.

## SETTING REGIONAL TRADE RULES

Below is a summary of the TPP’s 30 chapters. Schedules and annexes are attached to
the chapters of the Agreement related to goods and services trade, investment,
government procurement, and temporary entry of business persons. In addition, the
State-Owned Enterprises chapter includes country-specific exceptions in annexes.

### 1. Initial Provisions and General Definitions

Many TPP Parties have existing agreements with one another. The Initial Provisions and
General Definitions Chapter recognizes that the TPP can coexist with other international
trade agreements between the Parties, including the WTO Agreement, bilateral, and
regional agreements. It also provides definitions of terms used in more than one chapter
of the Agreement.

### 2. Trade in Goods

TPP Parties agree to eliminate and reduce tariffs and non-tariff barriers on industrial
goods, and to eliminate or reduce tariffs and other restrictive policies on agricultural
goods. The preferential access provided through the TPP will increase trade between the
TPP countries in this market of 800 million people and will support high-quality jobs in all
12 Parties. Most tariff elimination in industrial goods will be implemented immediately,
although tariffs on some products will be eliminated over longer timeframes as agreed by
the TPP Parties. The specific tariff cuts agreed by the TPP Parties are included in
schedules covering all goods. The TPP Parties will publish all tariffs and other information 
related to goods trade to ensure that small- and medium-sized businesses as well as
large companies can take advantage of the TPP. They also agree not to use
performance requirements, which are conditions such as local production requirements
that some countries impose on companies in order for them to obtain tariff benefits. In
addition, they agree not to impose WTO-inconsistent import and export restrictions and
duties, including on remanufactured goods – which will promote recycling of parts into
new products. If TPP Parties maintain import or export license requirements, they will
notify each other about the procedures so as to increase transparency and facilitate trade
flows.

On agricultural products, the Parties will eliminate or reduce tariffs and other restrictive
policies, which will increase agricultural trade in the region, and enhance food
security. In addition to eliminating or reducing tariffs, TPP Parties agree to promote
policy reforms, including by eliminating agricultural export subsidies, working together in
the WTO to develop disciplines on export state trading enterprises, export credits, and
limiting the timeframes allowed for restrictions on food exports so as to provide greater
food security in the region. The TPP Parties have also agreed to increased transparency
and cooperation on certain activities related to agricultural biotechnology.

### 3. Textiles and Apparel

The TPP Parties agree to eliminate tariffs on textiles and apparel, industries which are
important contributors to economic growth in several TPP Parties’ markets. Most tariffs
will be eliminated immediately, although tariffs on some sensitive products will be
eliminated over longer timeframes as agreed by the TPP Parties. The chapter also
includes specific rules of origin that require use of yarns and fabrics from the TPP region,
which will promote regional supply chains and investment in this sector, with a “short
supply list” mechanism that allows use of certain yarns and fabrics not widely available in
the region. In addition, the chapter includes commitments on customs cooperation and
enforcement to prevent duty evasion, smuggling and fraud, as well as a textile-specific
special safeguard to respond to serious damage or the threat of serious damage to
domestic industry in the event of a sudden surge in imports.

### 4. Rules of Origin

To provide simple rules of origin, promote regional supply chains, and help ensure the
TPP countries rather than non-participants are the primary beneficiaries of the
Agreement, the 12 Parties have agreed on a single set of rules of origin that define
whether a particular good is “originating” and therefore eligible to receive TPP
preferential tariff benefits. The product-specific rules of origin are attached to the text of
the Agreement. The TPP provides for “accumulation,” so that in general, inputs from one
TPP Party are treated the same as materials from any other TPP Party, if used to produce
a product in any TPP Party. The TPP Parties also have set rules that ensure businesses
can easily operate across the TPP region, by creating a common TPP-wide system of
showing and verifying that goods made in the TPP meet the rules of origin. Importers
will be able to claim preferential tariff treatment as long as they have the documentation
to support their claim. In addition, the chapter provides the competent authorities with
the procedures to verify claims appropriately. 

### 5. Customs Administration and Trade Facilitation

Complementing their WTO efforts to facilitate trade, the TPP Parties have agreed on rules
to enhance the facilitation of trade, improve transparency in customs procedures, and
ensure integrity in customs administration. These rules will help TPP businesses,
including small- and medium-sized businesses, by encouraging smooth processing in
customs and border procedures, and promote regional supply chains. TPP Parties have
agreed to transparent rules, including publishing their customs laws and regulations, as
well as providing for release of goods without unnecessary delay and on bond or
‘payment under protest’ where customs has not yet made a decision on the amount of
duties or fees owed. They agree to advance rulings on customs valuation and other
matters that will help businesses, both large and small, trade with predictability. They
also agree to disciplines on customs penalties that will help ensure these penalties are
administered in an impartial and transparent manner. Due to the importance of express
shipping to business sectors including small- and medium-sized companies, the TPP
countries have agreed to provide expedited customs procedures for express
shipments. To help counter smuggling and duty evasion, the TPP Parties agree to
provide information, when requested, to help each other enforce their respective customs
laws.

### 6. Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures

In developing SPS rules, the TPP Parties have advanced their shared interest in ensuring
transparent, non-discriminatory rules based on science, and reaffirmed their right to
protect human, animal or plant life or health in their countries. The TPP builds on WTO
SPS rules for identifying and managing risks in a manner that is no more trade restrictive
than necessary. TPP Parties agree to allow the public to comment on proposed SPS
measures to inform their decision-making, and to ensure traders understand the rules
they will need to follow. They agree that import programmes are based on the risks
associated with importations, and that import checks are carried out without undue
delay. The Parties also agree that emergency measures necessary for the protection of
human, animal, or plant life or health may be taken provided that the Party taking them
notifies all other Parties. The Party adopting an emergency measure will review the
scientific basis of that measure within six months and make available the results of these
reviews to any Party on request. In addition, TPP Parties commit to improve information
exchange related to equivalency or regionalisation requests and to promote systemsbased
audits to assess the effectiveness of regulatory controls of the exporting Party. In
an effort to rapidly resolve SPS matters that emerge between them, they have agreed to
establish a mechanism for consultations between governments.

### 7. Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT)

In developing TBT rules, the TPP Parties have agreed on transparent, non-discriminatory
rules for developing technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment
procedures, while preserving TPP Parties’ ability to fulfill legitimate objectives. They
agree to cooperate to ensure that technical regulations and standards do not create
unnecessary barriers to trade. To reduce costs for TPP businesses, especially small
businesses, TPP Parties agree to rules that will facilitate the acceptance of the results of 
conformity assessment procedures from the conformity assessment bodies in the other
TPP Parties, making it easier for companies to access TPP markets. Under the TPP,
Parties are required to allow for the public to comment on proposed technical regulations,
standards, and conformity assessment procedures to inform their regulatory processes
and to ensure traders understand the rules they will need to follow. They also will ensure
a reasonable interval between publication of technical regulations and conformity
assessment procedures, and their entry into force, so that businesses have sufficient
time to meet the new requirements. In addition, the TPP includes annexes related to
regulation of specific sectors to promote common regulatory approaches across the TPP
region. These sectors are cosmetics, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, information and
communications technology products, wine and distilled spirits, proprietary formulas for
prepackaged foods and food additives, and organic agricultural products.

### 8. Trade Remedies

The Trade Remedies chapter promotes transparency and due process in trade remedy
proceedings through recognition of best practices, but does not affect the TPP Parties’
rights and obligations under the WTO. The chapter provides for a transitional safeguard
mechanism, which allows a Party to apply a transitional safeguard measure during a
certain period of time if import increases as a result of the tariff cuts implemented under
the TPP cause serious injury to a domestic industry. These measures may be maintained
for up to two years, with a one-year extension, but must be progressively liberalized if
they last longer than a year. Parties imposing safeguard measures must follow
notification and consultation requirements. The chapter also sets out rules requiring that
a TPP Party applying a transitional safeguard measure provide mutually-agreed
compensation. The Parties may not impose more than one of the safeguards allowed
under TPP on the same product at the same time. The Parties may not impose a
transitional safeguard measure on any product imported under a TPP tariff rate quota,
and may exclude TPP products from a WTO safeguard measure if such imports are not a
cause or threat of serious injury.

### 9. Investment

In establishing investment rules, the TPP Parties set out rules requiring nondiscriminatory
investment policies and protections that assure basic rule of law
protections, while protecting the ability of Parties’ governments to achieve legitimate
public policy objectives. TPP provides the basic investment protections found in other
investment-related agreements, including national treatment; most-favored-nation
treatment; “minimum standard of treatment” for investments in accordance with
customary international law principles; prohibition of expropriation that is not for public
purpose, without due process, or without compensation; prohibition on “performance
requirements” such as local content or technology localization requirements; free transfer
of funds related to an investment, subject to exceptions in the TPP to ensure that
governments retain the flexibility to manage volatile capital flows, including through nondiscriminatory
temporary safeguard measures (such as capital controls) restricting
investment-related transfers in the context of a balance of payments crisis or the threat
thereof, and certain other economic crises or to protect the integrity and stability of the 
financial system; and freedom to appoint senior management positions of any
nationality.

TPP Parties adopt a “negative-list” basis, meaning that their markets are fully open to
foreign investors, except where they have taken an exception (non-conforming measure)
in one of two country-specific annexes: (1) current measures on which a Party accepts
an obligation not to make its measures more restrictive in the future and to bind any
future liberalization, and (2) measures and policies on which a Party retains full discretion
in the future.
The chapter also provides for neutral and transparent international arbitration of
investment disputes, with strong safeguards to prevent abusive and frivolous claims and
ensure the right of governments to regulate in the public interest, including on health,
safety, and environmental protection. The procedural safeguards include: transparent
arbitral proceedings, amicus curiae submissions, non-disputing Party submissions;
expedited review of frivolous claims and possible award of attorneys’ fees; review
procedure for an interim award; binding joint interpretations by TPP Parties; time limits
on bringing a claim; and rules to prevent a claimant pursuing the same claim in parallel
proceedings.

### 10. Cross-Border Trade in Services

Given the growing importance of services trade to TPP Parties, the 12 countries share an
interest in liberalized trade in this area. TPP includes core obligations found in the WTO
and other trade agreements: national treatment; most-favoured nation treatment;
market access, which provides that no TPP country may impose quantitative restrictions
on the supply of services (e.g., a limit on the number of suppliers or number of
transactions) or require a specific type of legal entity or joint venture; and local
presence, which means that no country may require a supplier from another country to
establish an office or affiliate, or to be resident, in its territory in order to supply a
service. TPP Parties accept these obligations on a “negative-list basis,” meaning that
their markets are fully open to services suppliers from TPP countries, except where they
have taken an exception (non-conforming measure) in one of two country-specific
annexes attached to the Agreement : (1) current measures on which a Party accepts an
obligation not to make its measures more restrictive in the future, and to bind any future
liberalisation, and (2) sectors and policies on which a country retains full discretion in the
future.

TPP Parties also agree to administer measures of general application in a reasonable,
objective, and impartial manner; and to accept requirements for transparency in the
development of new services regulations. Benefits of the chapter can be denied to shell
companies and to a service supplier owned by non-Parties with which a TPP Party
prohibits certain transactions. TPP Parties agree to permit free transfer of funds related
to the cross-border supply of a service. In addition, the chapter includes a professional
services annex encouraging cooperative work on licensing recognition and other
regulatory issues, and an annex on express delivery services.

### 11. Financial Services

The TPP Financial Services chapter will provide important cross-border and investment
market access opportunities, while ensuring that Parties will retain the ability to regulate
financial markets and institutions and to take emergency measures in the event of
crisis. The chapter includes core obligations found in other trade agreements, including:
national treatment; most-favored nation treatment; market access; and certain
provisions under the Investment chapter, including the minimum standard of
treatment. It provides for the sale of certain financial services across borders to a TPP
Party from a supplier in another TPP Party rather than requiring suppliers to establish
operations in the other country in order to sell their service – subject to registration or
authorization of cross-border financial services suppliers of another TPP Party in order to
help assure appropriate regulation and oversight. A supplier of a TPP Party may provide
a new financial service in another TPP market if domestic companies in that market are
allowed to do so. TPP Parties have country-specific exceptions to some of these rules in
two annexes attached to the TPP: (1) current measures on which a Party accepts an
obligation not to make its measures more restrictive in the future and to bind any future
liberalization, and (2) measures and policies on which a country retains full discretion in
the future.

TPP Parties also set out rules that formally recognize the importance of regulatory
procedures to expedite the offering of insurance services by licensed suppliers and
procedures to achieve this outcome. In addition, the TPP includes specific commitments
on portfolio management, electronic payment card services, and transfer of information
for data processing.

The Financial Services chapter provides for the resolution of disputes relating to certain
provisions through neutral and transparent investment arbitration. It includes specific
provisions on investment disputes related to the minimum standard of treatment, as well
as provisions requiring arbitrators to have financial services expertise, and a special
State-to-State mechanism to facilitate the application of the prudential exception and
other exceptions in the chapter in the context of investment disputes. Finally, it
includes exceptions to preserve broad discretion for TPP financial regulators to take
measures to promote financial stability and the integrity of their financial system,
including a prudential exception and exception of non-discriminatory measures in pursuit
of monetary or certain other policies.

### 12. Temporary Entry for Business Persons

The Temporary Entry for Business Persons chapter encourages authorities of TPP Parties
to provide information on applications for temporary entry, to ensure that application
fees are reasonable, and to make decisions on applications and inform applicants of
decisions as quickly as possible. TPP Parties agree to ensure that information on
requirements for temporary entry are readily available to the public, including by
publishing information promptly and online if possible, and providing explanatory
materials. The Parties agree to ongoing cooperation on temporary entry issues such as
visa processing. Almost all TPP Parties have made commitments on access for each
other’s business persons, which are in country-specific annexes.

### 13. Telecommunications

TPP Parties share an interest in ensuring efficient and reliable telecommunications
networks in their countries. These networks are critical to companies both large and
small for providing services. TPP’s pro-competitive network access rules cover mobile
suppliers. TPP Parties commit to ensure that major telecommunications services
suppliers in their territory provide interconnection, leased circuit services, co-location,
and access to poles and other facilities under reasonable terms and conditions and in a
timely manner. They also commit, where a license is required, to ensure transparency in
regulatory processes and that regulations do not generally discriminate against specific
technologies. And they commit to administer their procedures for the allocation and use
of scarce telecommunications resources, including frequencies, numbers and rights-ofway,
in an objective, timely, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. TPP Parties
recognize the importance of relying on market forces and commercial negotiations in the
telecommunications sector. They also agree that they may take steps to promote
competition in international mobile roaming services and facilitate the use of alternatives
to roaming. TPP Parties agree that, if a Party chooses to regulate rates for wholesale
international mobile roaming services, that Party shall permit operators from the TPP
countries that do not regulate such rates the opportunity to also benefit from the lower
rates.

### 14. Electronic Commerce

In the Electronic Commerce chapter, TPP Parties commit to ensuring free flow of the
global information and data that drive the Internet and the digital economy, subject to
legitimate public policy objectives such as personal information protection. The 12
Parties also agree not to require that TPP companies build data centers to store data as a
condition for operating in a TPP market, and, in addition, that source code of software is
not required to be transferred or accessed. The chapter prohibits the imposition of
customs duties on electronic transmissions, and prevents TPP Parties from favoring
national producers or suppliers of such products through discriminatory measures or
outright blocking. To protect consumers, TPP Parties agree to adopt and maintain
consumer protection laws related to fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities online
and to ensure that privacy and other consumer protections can be enforced in TPP
markets. Parties also are required to have measures to stop unsolicited commercial
electronic messages. To facilitate electronic commerce, the chapter includes provisions
encouraging TPP Parties to promote paperless trading between businesses and the
government, such as electronic customs forms; and providing for electronic
authentication and signatures for commercial transactions. A number of obligations in
this chapter are subject to relevant non-conforming measures of individual TPP
members. The 12 Parties agree to cooperate to help small- and medium-sized business
take advantage of electronic commerce, and the chapter encourages cooperation on
policies regarding personal information protection, online consumer protection,
cybersecurity threats and cybersecurity capacity.

### 15. Government Procurement

TPP Parties share an interest in accessing each other’s large government procurement
markets through transparent, predictable, and non-discriminatory rules. In the
Government Procurement chapter, TPP Parties commit to core disciplines of national
treatment and non-discrimination. They also agree to publish relevant information in a
timely manner, to allow sufficient time for suppliers to obtain the tender documentation
and submit a bid, to treat tenders fairly and impartially, and to maintain confidentiality of
tenders. In addition, the Parties agree to use fair and objective technical specifications,
to award contracts based solely on the evaluation criteria specified in the notices and
tender documentation, and to establish due process procedures to question or review
complaints about an award. Each Party agrees to a positive list of entities and activities
that are covered by the chapter, which are listed in annexes.

### 16. Competition Policy

TPP Parties share an interest in ensuring a framework of fair competition in the region
through rules that require TPP Parties to maintain legal regimes that prohibit
anticompetitive business conduct, as well as fraudulent and deceptive commercial
activities that harm consumers.

TPP Parties agree to adopt or maintain national competition laws that proscribe
anticompetitive business conduct and work to apply these laws to all commercial
activities in their territories. To ensure that such laws are effectively implemented, TPP
Parties agree to establish or maintain authorities responsible for the enforcement of
national competition laws, and adopt or maintain laws or regulations that proscribe
fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities that cause harm or potential harm to
consumers. Parties also agree to cooperate, as appropriate, on matters of mutual
interest related to competition activities. The 12 Parties agree to obligations on due
process and procedural fairness, as well as private rights of action for injury caused by a
violation of a Party’s national competition law. In addition, TPP Parties agree to
cooperate in the area of competition policy and competition law enforcement, including
through notification, consultation and exchange of information. The chapter is not
subject to the dispute settlement provisions of the TPP, but TPP Parties may consult on
concerns related to the chapter.

### 17. State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and Designated Monopolies

All TPP Parties have SOEs, which often play a role in providing public services and other
activities, but TPP Parties recognize the benefit of agreeing on a framework of rules on
SOEs. The SOE chapter covers large SOEs that are principally engaged in commercial
activities. Parties agree to ensure that their SOEs make commercial purchases and sales
on the basis of commercial considerations, except when doing so would be inconsistent
with any mandate under which an SOE is operating that would require it to provide public
services. They also agree to ensure that their SOEs or designated monopolies do not
discriminate against the enterprises, goods, and services of other Parties. Parties agree
to provide their courts with jurisdiction over commercial activities of foreign SOEs in their
territory, and to ensure that administrative bodies regulating both SOEs and private
companies do so in an impartial manner. TPP Parties agree to not cause adverse effects
to the interests of other TPP Parties in providing non-commercial assistance to SOEs, or 
injury to another Party’s domestic industry by providing non-commercial assistance to an
SOE that produces and sells goods in that other Party’s territory. TPP Parties agree to
share a list of their SOEs with the other TPP Parties and to provide, upon request,
additional information about the extent of government ownership or control and the noncommercial
assistance they provide to SOEs. There are some exceptions from the
obligations in the chapter, for example, where there is a national or global economy
emergency, as well as country-specific exceptions that are set out in annexes.

### 18. Intellectual Property

TPP’s Intellectual Property (IP) chapter covers patents, trademarks, copyrights, industrial
designs, geographical indications, trade secrets, other forms of intellectual property, and
enforcement of intellectual property rights, as well as areas in which Parties agree to
cooperate. The IP chapter will make it easier for businesses to search, register, and
protect IP rights in new markets, which is particularly important for small businesses.
The chapter establishes standards for patents, based on the WTO’s TRIPS Agreement and
international best practices. On trademarks, it provides protections of brand names and
other signs that businesses and individuals use to distinguish their products in the
marketplace. The chapter also requires certain transparency and due process safeguards
with respect to the protection of new geographical indications, including for geographical
indications recognized or protected through international agreements. These include
confirmation of understandings on the relationship between trademarks and geographical
indications, as well as safeguards regarding the use of commonly used terms.

In addition, the chapter contains pharmaceutical-related provisions that facilitate both
the development of innovative, life-saving medicines and the availability of generic
medicines, taking into account the time that various Parties may need to meet these
standards. The chapter includes commitments relating to the protection of undisclosed
test and other data submitted to obtain marketing approval of a new pharmaceutical or
agricultural chemicals product. It also reaffirms Parties’ commitment to the WTO’s 2001
Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, and in particular confirms that
Parties are not prevented from taking measures to protect public health, including in the
case of epidemics such as HIV/AIDS.

In copyright, the IP chapter establishes commitments requiring protection for works,
performances, and phonograms such as songs, movies, books, and software, and
includes effective and balanced provisions on technological protection measures and
rights management information. As a complement to these commitments, the chapter
includes an obligation for Parties to continuously seek to achieve balance in copyright
systems through among other things, exceptions and limitations for legitimate purposes,
including in the digital environment. The chapter requires Parties to establish or
maintain a framework of copyright safe harbors for Internet Service Providers
(ISPs). These obligations do not permit Parties to make such safe harbors contingent on
ISPs monitoring their systems for infringing activity.

Finally, TPP Parties agree to provide strong enforcement systems, including, for example,
civil procedures, provisional measures, border measures, and criminal procedures and
penalties for commercial-scale trademark counterfeiting and copyright or related rights
piracy. In particular, TPP Parties will provide the legal means to prevent the
misappropriation of trade secrets, and establish criminal procedures and penalties for
trade secret theft, including by means of cyber-theft, and for cam-cording.

### 19. Labour

All TPP Parties are International Labour Organization (ILO) members and recognize the
importance of promoting internationally recognized labour rights. TPP Parties agree to
adopt and maintain in their laws and practices the fundamental labour rights as
recognized in the ILO 1998 Declaration, namely freedom of association and the right to
collective bargaining; elimination of forced labour; abolition of child labour and a
prohibition on the worst forms of child labour; and elimination of discrimination in
employment. They also agree to have laws governing minimum wages, hours of work,
and occupational safety and health. These commitments also apply to export processing
zones. The 12 Parties agree not to waive or derogate from laws implementing
fundamental labour rights in order to attract trade or investment, and not to fail to
effectively enforce their labour laws in a sustained or recurring pattern that would affect
trade or investment between the TPP Parties. In addition to commitments by Parties to
eliminate forced labour in their own countries, the Labour chapter includes commitments
to discourage importation of goods that are produced by forced labour or child labour, or
that contain inputs produced by forced labour, regardless of whether the source country
is a TPP Party. Each of the 12 TPP Parties commits to ensure access to fair, equitable
and transparent administrative and judicial proceedings and to provide effective remedies
for violations of its labour laws. They also agree to public participation in implementation
of the Labour chapter, including establishing mechanisms to obtain public input.
The commitments in the chapter are subject to the dispute settlement procedures laid
out in the Dispute Settlement chapter. To promote the rapid resolution of labour issues
between TPP Parties, the Labour chapter also establishes a labour dialogue that Parties
may choose to use to try to resolve any labour issue between them that arises under the
chapter. This dialogue allows for expeditious consideration of matters and for Parties to
mutually agree to a course of action to address issues. The Labour chapter establishes a
mechanism for cooperation on labour issues, including opportunities for stakeholder input
in identifying areas of cooperation and participation, as appropriate and jointly agreed, in
cooperative activities.

### 20. Environment

As home to a significant portion of the world’s people, wildlife, plants and marine species,
TPP Parties share a strong commitment to protecting and conserving the environment,
including by working together to address environmental challenges, such as pollution,
illegal wildlife trafficking, illegal logging, illegal fishing, and protection of the marine
environment. The 12 Parties agree to effectively enforce their environmental laws; and
not to weaken environmental laws in order to encourage trade or investment. They also
agree to fulfil their obligations under the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and to take measures to combat
and cooperate to prevent trade in wild fauna and flora that has been taken illegally. In
addition, the Parties agree to promote sustainable forest management, and to protect
and conserve wild fauna and flora that they have identified as being at risk in their
territories, including through measures to conserve the ecological integrity of specially
protected natural areas, such as wetlands. In an effort to protect their shared oceans,
TPP Parties agree to sustainable fisheries management, to promote conservation of
important marine species, including sharks, to combat illegal fishing, and to prohibit
some of the most harmful fisheries subsidies that negatively affect overfished fish stocks,
and that support illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing. They also agree to enhance
transparency related to such subsidy programs, and to make best efforts to refrain from
introducing new subsidies that contribute to overfishing or overcapacity.

TPP Parties also agree to protect the marine environment from ship pollution and to
protect the ozone layer from ozone depleting substances. They reaffirm their
commitment to implement the multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) they have
joined. The Parties commit to provide transparency in environmental decision-making,
implementation and enforcement. In addition, the Parties agree to provide opportunities
for public input in implementation of the Environment chapter, including through public
submissions and public sessions of the Environment Committee established to oversee
chapter implementation. The chapter is subject to the dispute settlement procedure laid
out in the Dispute Settlement chapter. The Parties further agree to encourage voluntary
environmental initiatives, such as corporate social responsibility programs. Finally, the
Parties commit to cooperate to address matters of joint or common interest, including in
the areas of conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and transition to lowemissions
and resilient economies.

### 21. Cooperation and Capacity Building

The economies of the 12 TPP Parties are diverse. All Parties recognise that the TPP
lesser-developed Parties may face particular challenges in implementing the Agreement,
and in taking full advantage of the opportunities it creates. To address these challenges,
the Cooperation and Capacity Building chapter establishes a Committee on Cooperation
and Capacity Building to identify and review areas for potential cooperative and capacity
building efforts. Parties’ activities are on a mutually agreed basis and subject to the
availability of resources. This Committee will facilitate exchange of information to help
with requests related to cooperation and capacity building.

### 22. Competitiveness and Business Facilitation

The Competitiveness and Business Facilitation chapter aims to help the TPP reach its
potential to improve the competitiveness of the participating countries, and the AsiaPacific
region as a whole. The chapter creates formal mechanisms to review the impact
of the TPP on competitiveness of the Parties, through dialogues among governments and
between government, business, and civil society, with a particular focus on deepening
regional supply chains, to assess progress, take advantage of new opportunities, and
address any challenges that may emerge once the TPP is in force. Among these will be
the Committee on Competitiveness and Business Facilitation, which will meet regularly to 
review the TPP’s impact on regional and national competitiveness, and on regional
economic integration. The Committee will consider advice and recommendations from
stakeholders on ways the TPP can further enhance competitiveness, including enhancing
the participation of micro, small- and medium-sized enterprises in regional supply
chains. The chapter also establishes a basic framework for Committee to assess supply
chain performance under the Agreement, including ways to promote SME participation in
supply chains; and review of stakeholder and expert input.

### 23. Development

The TPP Parties seek to ensure that the TPP will be a high-standard model for trade and
economic integration, and in particular to ensure that all TPP Parties can obtain the
complete benefits of the TPP, are fully able to implement their commitments, and emerge
as more prosperous societies with strong markets. The Development chapter includes
three specific areas to be considered for collaborative work once TPP enters into force for
each Party: (1) broad-based economic growth, including sustainable development,
poverty reduction, and promotion of small businesses; (2) women and economic growth,
including helping women build capacity and skill, enhancing women’s access to markets,
obtaining technology and financing, establishing women’s leadership networks, and
identifying best practices in workplace flexibility; and (3) education, science and
technology, research, and innovation. The chapter establishes a TPP Development
Committee, which will meet regularly to promote voluntary cooperative work in these
areas and new opportunities as they arise.

### 24. Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises

TPP Parties have a shared interest in promoting the participation of small- and mediumsized
enterprises in trade and to ensure that small- and medium-sized enterprises share
in the benefits of the TPP. Complementing the commitments throughout other chapters
of the TPP on market access, paperwork reduction, Internet access, trade facilitation,
express delivery and others, the Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprise chapter includes
commitments by each TPP Party to create a user-friendly websites targeted at small- and
medium-sized enterprise users to provide easily accessible information on the TPP and
ways small firms can take advantage of it, including description of the provisions of TPP
relevant to small- and medium-sized enterprises; regulations and procedures concerning
intellectual property rights; foreign investment regulations; business registration
procedures; employment regulations; and taxation information. In addition, the chapter
establishes a Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises Committee that will meet regularly to
review how well the TPP is serving small- and medium-sized enterprises, consider ways
to further enhance its benefits, and oversee cooperation or capacity building activities to
support small- and medium-sized enterprises through export counseling, assistance, and
training programs for small- and medium-sized enterprises; information sharing; trade
finance; and other activities.

### 25. Regulatory Coherence

TPP’s Regulatory Coherence chapter will help ensure an open, fair, and predictable
regulatory environment for businesses operating in the TPP markets by encouraging
transparency, impartiality, and coordination across each government to achieve a 
coherent regulatory approach. The chapter aims to facilitate regulatory coherence in
each TPP country by promoting mechanisms for effective interagency consultation and
coordination for agencies. It encourages widely-accepted good regulatory practices, such
as impact assessments of proposed regulatory measures, communication of the grounds
for the selection of chosen regulatory alternatives and the nature of the regulation being
introduced. The chapter also includes provisions to help ensure regulations are written
clearly and concisely, that the public has access to information on new regulatory
measures, if possible online, and that existing regulatory measures are periodically
reviewed to determine if they remain the most effective means of achieving the desired
objective. In addition, it encourages TPP Parties to provide an annual public notice of all
regulatory measures it expects to take. Toward these ends, the chapter establishes a
Committee which will give TPP countries, businesses, and civil society continuing
opportunities to report on implementation, share experiences on best practices, and
consider potential areas for cooperation. The chapter does not in any way affect the
rights of TPP Parties to regulate for public health, safety, security, and other public
interest reasons.

### 26. Transparency and Anti-Corruption

The TPP’s Transparency and Anti-Corruption chapter aims to promote the goal, shared by
all TPP Parties, of strengthening good governance and addressing the corrosive effects
bribery and corruption can have on their economies. Under the Transparency and AntiCorruption
chapter, TPP Parties need to ensure that their laws, regulations, and
administrative rulings of general application with respect to any matter covered by the
TPP are publicly available and that, to the extent possible, regulations that are likely to
affect trade or investment between the Parties are subject to notice and comment. TPP
Parties agree to ensure certain due process rights for TPP stakeholders in connection with
administrative proceedings, including prompt review through impartial judicial or
administrative tribunals or procedures. They also agree to adopt or maintain laws
criminalising offering to, or solicitation of, undue advantages by a public official, as well
as other acts of corruption affecting international trade or investment. Parties also
commit to effectively enforce their anticorruption laws and regulations. In addition, they
agree to endeavor to adopt or maintain codes or standards of conduct for their public
officials, as well as measures to identify and manage conflicts of interest, to increase
training of public officials, to take steps to discourage gifts, to facilitate reporting of acts
of corruption, and to provide for disciplinary or other measures for public officials
engaging in acts of corruption. In an Annex to this chapter, TPP Parties also agree to
provisions that promote transparency and procedural fairness with respect to listing and
reimbursement for pharmaceutical products or medical devices. Commitments in this
annex are not subject to dispute settlement procedures.

### 27. Administrative and Institutional Provisions

The Administrative and Institutional Provisions Chapter sets out the institutional
framework by which the Parties will assess and guide implementation or operation of the
TPP, in particular by establishing the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission, composed of
Ministers or senior level officials, to oversee the implementation or operation of the
Agreement and guide its future evolution. This Commission will review the economic 
relationship and partnership among the Parties on a periodic basis to ensure that the
Agreement remains relevant to the trade and investment challenges confronting the
Parties. The chapter also requires each Party to designate an overall contact point to
facilitate communications between the Parties, and creates a mechanism through which a
Party that has a specific transition period for an obligation must report on its plans for,
and progress toward, implementing that obligation. This ensures greater transparency
with respect to the implementation of Parties’ obligations.

### 28. Dispute Settlement

The Dispute Settlement chapter is intended to allow Parties to expeditiously address
disputes between them over implementation of the TPP. TPP Parties will make every
attempt to resolve disputes through cooperation and consultation and encourage the use
of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms when appropriate. When this is not
possible, TPP Parties aim to have these disputes resolved through impartial, unbiased
panels. The dispute settlement mechanism created in this chapter applies across the
TPP, with few specific exceptions. The public in each TPP Party will be able to follow
proceedings, since submissions made in disputes will be made available to the public,
hearings will be open to the public unless the disputing Parties otherwise agree, and the
final report presented by panels will also be made available to the public. Panels will
consider requests from non-governmental entities located in the territory of any
disputing Party to provide written views regarding the dispute to panels during dispute
settlement proceedings.

Should consultations fail to resolve an issue, Parties may request establishment of a
panel, which would be established within 60 days after the date of receipt of a request
for consultations or 30 days after the date of receipt of a request related to perishable
goods. Panels will be composed of three international trade and subject matter experts
independent of the disputing Parties, with procedures available to ensure that a panel
can be composed even if a Party fails to appoint a panelist within a set period of
time. These panelists will be subject to a code of conduct to ensure the integrity of the
dispute settlement mechanism. They will present an initial report to the disputing Parties
within 150 days after the last panelist is appointed or 120 days in cases of urgency, such
as cases related to perishable goods. The initial report will be confidential, to enable
Parties to offer comments. The final report must be presented no later than 30 days
after the presentation of the initial report and must be made public within 15 days,
subject to the protection of any confidential information in the report.

To maximize compliance, the Dispute Settlement chapter allows for the use of trade
retaliation (e.g., suspension of benefits), if a Party found not to have complied with its
obligations fails to bring itself into compliance with its obligations. Before use of trade
retaliation, a Party found in violation can negotiate or arbitrate a reasonable period of
time in which to remedy the breach.

### 29. Exceptions

The Exceptions Chapter ensures that flexibilities are available to all TPP Parties that
guarantee full rights to regulate in the public interest, including for a Party’s essential 
security interest and other public welfare reasons. This chapter incorporates the general
exceptions provided for in Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994
to the goods trade-related provisions, specifying that nothing in the TPP shall be
construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by a Party of measures necessary to,
among other things, protect public morals, protect human, animal or plant life or health,
protect intellectual property, enforce measures relating to products of prison labour, and
measures relating to conservation of exhaustible natural resources.

The chapter also contains the similar general exceptions provided for in Article XIV of the
General Agreement on Trade in Services with respect to the services trade-related
provisions.

The chapter includes a self-judging exception, applicable to the entire TPP, which makes
clear that a Party may take any measure it considers necessary for the protection of its
essential security interests. It also defines the circumstances and conditions under which
a Party may impose temporary safeguard measures (such as capital controls) restricting
transfers – such as contributions to capital, transfers of profits and dividends, payments
of interest or royalties, and payments under a contract – related to covered investments,
to ensure that governments retain the flexibility to manage volatile capital flows, in the
contexts of balance of payments or other economic crises, or threats thereof. In
addition, it specifies that no Party is obligated to furnish information under the TPP if it
would be contrary to its law or public interest, or would prejudice the legitimate
commercial interests of particular enterprises. A Party may elect to deny the benefits
of Investor-State dispute settlement with respect to a claim challenging a tobacco
control measure of the Party.

### 30. Final Provisions

The Final Provisions chapter defines the way the TPP will enter into force, the way in
which it can be amended, the rules that establish the process for other States or
separate customs territories to join the TPP in the future, the means by which Parties can
withdraw, and the authentic languages of the TPP. It also designates a Depositary for
the Agreement responsible for receiving and disseminating documents.

The chapter ensures that the TPP can be amended, with the agreement of all Parties and
after each Party completes its applicable legal procedures and notifies the Depositary in
writing. It specifies that the TPP is open to accession by members of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Forum and other States or separate customs territories as agreed
by the Parties, again after completing applicable legal procedures in each Party. The
Final Provisions chapter also specifies the procedures under which a Party can withdraw
from the TPP.
